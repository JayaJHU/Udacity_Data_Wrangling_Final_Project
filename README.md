# Wrangle OpenStreetMap Data
In this project I used data wrangling techniques, such as assessing data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity to clean OpenStreetMap data for a part of the world that I care.

1. Acquire and generate a sample data
2. Count the types of tags available in the data
3. Audit the data for potential problems
4. Clean the data by fixing the problems
5. Prepare the data to be inserted into a SQL database

The steps above served as a good guide for me as it helped me get through the data wrangling project carefully. It helped me to successfully go through the auditing and cleaning process of this dataset. Eventually, transferring the cleaned data to .csv files.
